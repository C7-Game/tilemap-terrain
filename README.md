# Instructions
This project will not run without converting civ3 assets to .png files corresponding with the `.import` files in the Terrain folder. To create these files, use the pcx to png conversion function in the GoodyHut repo scripts folder.

# What Is This?
A prototype for replacing the custom map rendering with the Godot 4 tilemap node. This would yield the following benefits:
- simplify game code significantly
- remove tile seam artifacts from the map
- improve performance
- improve C7's integration with Godot editor
